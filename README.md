### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jonathan LEVY.

Here's my GitHub account for academic and professional projects. Up to now, it's mainly about C++ and CUDA university projects.
You may find personal projects on my other, separate github account. Please look at my personal page to find these projects: [j-levy.github.io](https://j-levy.github.io)

I currently live in Ireland, but when a good opportunity comes out, I'm always ready to move.
